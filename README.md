# example-rust-http-service
This is an example implementation of a basic Rust HTTP service using:

* [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)
* Multi-Stage Container Build

## Getting Started

### Requirements
- [Rust Toolchain (rustc/cargo)](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) >= 1.86.0
  * Use Nix development shell provided by `flake.nix` which includes .
  * Or download [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
    - On MacOS `brew install rustup`
- [podman](https://podman.io/) >= 5.25
  * On MacOS: Install through Podman Desktop installer from https://podman.io/
  * On Ubuntu: `apt-get install -y podman`
- [podman-compose](https://docs.podman.io/en/stable/markdown/podman-compose.1.html) >= 1.2.0
  * On MacOS: `brew install podman-compose`
  * On Ubuntu: `apt-get install -y python3-pip` then `pip3 install podman-compose`

### Running Tests
```
cargo test --all
```

### Starting The Server

#### Using Cargo
This is the quickest way to start the server.

```
cargo run -p example-rust-http-service
```

#### From The Executable Binary
This builds an executable binary.

This is how we would start the server in a production and containerized environment.

```
# This will generate the executable binary
cargo build --release

# This will start the server
./target/release/example-rust-http-service
```

#### From within a container
This builds a container image that contains the executable binary of our server.

```
podman compose up
```

To rebuild the image:
```
podman compose build
```

### Confirming Server Behavior
A server process should be bound on port 8080 and should respond to GET /ping.

```
‚ùØ curl localhost:8080/ping
pong!
```
